# Simple-Budget-Control

This is a simple budget planner, similar to the idea of balancing a checkbook. It's all based off of a custom automated spreadsheet I've been using for over a decade and after having a few people ask me for a version of it that's easier to maintain, so here it is.

Currently, this is like MVP v0.1. It only uses localStorage for retaining information, currently, so kinda prone to data loss depending on your cleaning pattern. I have a decent roadmap and there will be more updates soon, especially as I start to use this fulltime.

## Screenshots

## Stack
